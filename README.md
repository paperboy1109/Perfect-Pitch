# Pitch Perfect

This is an iPhone app that I made for my Udacity iOS Nanodegree.  It allows the user to record his or her voice and will then modulate the recorded audio to sound like a Chipmunk, Kylo Ren, or any of four other playback settings. These other settings also let the user speed up or slow down the rate of playback.  If you grew up in the 90's, it will probably remind you of the [Yak Bak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yak_Bak) toys &#128526;

# Version History

Pitch Perfect was originally developed using Xcode 7 and Swift 2.2, but has been updated to work with **Xcode 8.0** and **Swift 3.0**.
